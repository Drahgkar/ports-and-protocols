# Ports and Protocols

## Description
This list is a conglomeration of the IANA port and protocol list, shauryasharma's list, ITI's OT ports and protocols, malware ports gathered from various people, and my own research.  List is provided in CSV format in order to make it easier to ingest into various other tooling. Of course, updates and corrections are appreciated.

## Roadmap
Eventually I'd like to include references for as many of these ports as I can. Especially the ports that IANA isn't tracking.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Shaurya Sharma for the rather good port listing at https://github.com/shauryasharma-05/All-Ports-CheatSheet-/blob/master/AllPortsDB.txt<br>
ITI for the OT protocol list at https://github.com/ITI/ICS-Security-Tools/blob/master/protocols/PORTS.md<br>
